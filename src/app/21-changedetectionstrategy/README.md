Detection strategy relies on the concept of inmutability. The default detection strategy will detect and apply changes whe the object is updated while the onPush detection strategy will only update the component when a new input is provided. So this means it will only reflect changes for inmutable objects making the component faster since it doesnt have to be aware of the objects data update
